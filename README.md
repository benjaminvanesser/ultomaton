ULTOMATON is an effects generator built to accompany any acoustic instrumentalist while improvising. It uses John Conway's 'Game of Life', a cellular automaton, to trigger events. These events are reflected in changes of ULTOMATON's effect parameters. 

The Game of Life can be set to spawn life manually or based on the incoming attack of the performer. Although the Game of Life is at the very core of this application, ULTOMATON is very much a game of chance, which can be controlled by the performer to a great extent. As different settings have a considerable influence on the auditory result, ULTOMATON provides a myriad of electronic backdrops to improvise to. 

Quick start:

- Set up your audio input and output in the 'audio configuration' menu.
- Set up the routing matrix to create an effect chain.
- Activate the 'R''s in the effect modules specified in the routing matrix. This will allow it to receive events from the Game of Life
- Spawn life in the Game of Life (manually or by enabling 'attack detection')
- Improvise

Mapping:

Almost all parameters are available for MIDI- and Key-mapping. Use shortcuts 'm' for MIDI-mapping and 'k' for Key-mapping to enable mapping mode. Select the parameter you want to map and touch the control you want to map it to. To exit mapping mode, hit 'esc'.
